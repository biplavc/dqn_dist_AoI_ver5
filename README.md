*** ver2 is RB specific, ver1 was channel specific.

*** ver2 had action space which made it difficult to do larger operations in the other schedulers. So in ver3, remove concept of action space and directly pass the selected users.

*** ver 4 will have the ordered AoI idea. UL will be based on number of DLs and DL will be based on the excluding the ones that were allowed to UL.

## whenever actions removed, commented # remove_action
